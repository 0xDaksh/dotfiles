# Note on Compton's kawase blur

To achieve the kawase blur, you need a fork of compton available on aur:

[compton-tryone-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/compton-tryone-git)

Remove the original compton, and install this one. logout and login back, and boom it should show that sexy kawase blur!
