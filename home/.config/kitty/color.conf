# The opacity of the background. A number between 0 and 1, where 1 is opaque and 0 is fully transparent.
# This will only work if supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under X11). Note
# that it only sets the default background color's opacity. This is so that
# things like the status bar in vim, powerline prompts, etc. still look good.
# But it means that if you use a color theme with a background color in your
# editor, it will not be rendered as transparent.  Instead you should change the
# default background color in your kitty config and not use a background color
# in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape codes to set the terminals
# default colors in a shell script to launch your editor.
# Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly significant) performance hit.
